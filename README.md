# Your DICOMs Project Title (Replace with your actual project name)

## Description

This project is an endpoint to get DICOMs from a specified IP address, port, and Application Entity Title (AET).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [project name]
    ```

    (Replace `[repository URL]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository and `[project name]` with the name of your project folder.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (if you haven't already):**

    We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. If you already have a virtual environment named `dicoms_aet`, you can skip this step. Otherwise, create it using the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv dicoms_aet
    ```

    (You might need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your system.)

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - **On Windows:**

      ```bash
      .\dicoms_aet\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**

      ```bash
      source dicoms_aet/bin/activate
      ```

    (You will know the virtual environment is active when you see `(dicoms_aet)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.)

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Make sure you have created the `requirements.txt` file as described in the previous steps.)
